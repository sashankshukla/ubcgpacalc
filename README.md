This first version of this chrome extension allows UBC students to
 - input their course grades on the 100 point scale
 - input how many credits each course is
 - get back a 4.0 scale GPA based on UBC calculation steps and criteria which is more commonly used for resumes,   
   CV's , portfolios and LinkedIn.

The tool takes away the pain of having to switch to tabs to see the conversion scale, open calculators and overall waste a lot of valuable time. 
Students can just input values whilst being on the grades summary page and recieve a GPA.

The next version I hope to develop can hopefully implement web scraping of the grades page directly, such that even the inputing of the data fields is removed.
