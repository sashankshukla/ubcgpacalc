Avaiable on the chrome web store : [UBC GPA Calculator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ubc-gpa-calculator/hflhpnifkonoajnjhbniofgkchijncdj?utm_source=googleads&utm_medium=adgroup5&utm_campaign=adgroup5&utm_id=adgroup5&gclid=CjwKCAiA_omPBhBBEiwAcg7smZEO9c_V2eYCU7lxxh2p0XfzHbZb_IPmZ970AePXOVYzh865AOry7BoC3qAQAvD_BwE)

This first version of this chrome extension allows UBC students to

- input their course grades on the 100 point scale
- input how many credits each course is
- get back a 4.0 scale GPA based on UBC calculation steps and criteria which is more commonly used for resumes,
CV's , portfolios and LinkedIn.

The tool takes away the pain of having to switch to tabs to see the conversion scale, open calculators and overall waste a lot of valuable time. Students can just input values whilst being on the grades summary page and receive a GPA.
